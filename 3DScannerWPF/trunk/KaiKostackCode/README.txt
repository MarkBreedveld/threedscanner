The mesh creation procedure has been taken from Kais Code. Thanks Kai.

But there have been some changes during time and they should be synchronized from this peace of code. 
glview.c which is in this prject

The only thing I did was making it sustainable by making it object orientated 
and making separations in the different faces.

Also a gui makes things more clear.

Last but not least, this project was build upon openni which could make futher development on new hardware
more easy.

I hope it is clear what is mine and what is Kai Kostacks work...
